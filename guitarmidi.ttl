# The full description of the plugin is in this file, which is linked to from
# `manifest.ttl`.  This is done so the host only needs to scan the relatively
# small `manifest.ttl` files to quickly discover all plugins.

# First the type of the plugin is described.  All plugins must explicitly list
# `lv2:Plugin` as a type.  A more specific type should also be given, where
# applicable, so hosts can present a nicer UI for loading plugins.  Note that
# this URI is the identifier of the plugin, so if it does not match the one in
# `manifest.ttl`, the host will not discover the plugin data at all.
