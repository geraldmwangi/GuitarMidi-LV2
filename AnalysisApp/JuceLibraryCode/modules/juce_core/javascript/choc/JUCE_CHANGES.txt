The files in this directory were downloaded from the choc repository at
https://github.com/Tracktion/choc.

In order to avoid exposing any symbols in the choc implementation, the files were modified by
prepending all `namespace choc...` lines with `namespace {`, and by adding corresponding closing
brackets as well.

Enclosing all choc definitions in an anonymous namespace allows JUCE based projects to use an
external copy of choc without running into multiply defined symbol compilation errors.

By placing the anonymous namespace encapsulation inside the choc header files we avoid the issue of
including the system headers in the namespace as well.
