/**
    A high-resolution periodic timer.

    This provides accurately-timed regular callbacks. Unlike the normal Timer
    class, this one uses a dedicated thread, not the message thread, so is
    far more stable and precise.

    You should only use this class in situations where you really need accuracy,
    because unlike the normal Timer class, which is very lightweight and cheap
    the HighResolutionTimer will use far more resources and require thread
    safety considerations.

        On some platforms the dedicated timer thread may be shared with
        other HighResolutionTimer's so aim to complete any work in this
        callback as fast as possible.

        It's perfectly ok to call startTimer() or stopTimer() from within this
        callback to change the subsequent intervals. However, if you call
        stopTimer() in the callback it's still best practice to call stopTimer()

        will not be less than the interval length passed in.

        In exceptional circumstances the dedicated timer thread may not start,
        if this is a potential concern for your use case, you can call isTimerRunning()
        to confirm if the timer actually started.
