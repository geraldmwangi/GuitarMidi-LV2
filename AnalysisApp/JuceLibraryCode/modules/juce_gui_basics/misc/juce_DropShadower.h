/**
    Adds a drop-shadow to a component.

    This object creates and manages a set of components which sit around a
    component, creating a gaussian shadow around it. The components will track
    the position of the component and if it's brought to the front they'll also
    follow this.

    For desktop windows you don't need to use this class directly - just
    set the Component::windowHasDropShadow flag when calling
    Component::addToDesktop(), and the system will create one of these if it's
    needed (which it obviously isn't on the Mac, for example).
